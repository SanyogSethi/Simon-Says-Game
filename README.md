In this game, firstly the user have to press a key on his/her keyboard to initiate the game. Then a random color out of the four colors would pop up. The user have to memorize and press that exact color.
THis is the change:::
After a successful attempt of the user, a levelup would be initiated which blinks another color. The user has to memorize the pattern in which the colors blink and have to press the colors in that exact sequence.
The system will only blink the most recent color but the user has to memorize the previous colors and their sequence as well.

For Devs:
I used two lists named as gameSeq and userSeq to track the sequence generated by the system and the sequence entered by the user respectively.
A match function is called every time the user presses a button to check if he/she entered the same color matching the sequence or not. There are three cases that can occur in this function:
1. **The user clicks a correct color but the sequence is not completed:** In this case, the system has to continue matching the sequence further.
2. **The user clicks a correct color and the sequence is completed:** In this case, the levelUp() function has to be initiated.
3. **The user clicks an incorrect color:** The gameOver() function is called resetting the lvl, userSeq, gameSeq and maxScore variables amd display the current and max Scores.
